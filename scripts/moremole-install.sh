# Links both names in ~/.local/bin to this folder's `mole`, so updates to the
# folder take effect at once; adds ~/.local/bin to PATH in ~/.zshrc when it is
# missing; replaces an older `alias mm=` line; builds Analyze, Status and
# Software updates when they were never built; offers to remove the official
# Mole when Homebrew installed it; links Mole's own names, mo and mole, too
# when no other Mole answers to them; and offers Tab completion for moremole
# and mm. Safe to run again.
