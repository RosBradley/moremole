# MoreMole installer. Downloads the newest MoreMole release from GitHub,
# checks every file against the checksums published with the release, and
# installs it in ~/.local/share/moremole. A first install then sets up the
# moremole and mm commands (scripts/moremole-install.sh).
#
# Install:  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RosBradley/moremole/moremole/moremole-get.sh | bash
# Update:   Update MoreMole in the menu runs the installed copy of this script
#           with --update, which replaces the copy it is in. Your settings in
#           ~/.config/mole stay.
